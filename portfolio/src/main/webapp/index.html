      <h1>Gianluca Delgado's Portfolio</h1>
      <img src="/images/portfolio_pic.jpeg">
      <p>Hi! My name is Gianluca Delgado and I am currently a sophomore studying Physics at the California Institute of Technology. 
          My academic interest currently include Quantum Information and Condensed Matter Theory and I plan to attend grad school
          once I finish my B.S. I also really enjoy playing soccer and billiards whenever I have time and I actually plan on starting
          a billiards club once I get back to campus. I also have a soft spot for coffee and I am currently attempting to build a nice
          repitoire of brewing methods.
